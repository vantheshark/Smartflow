- Fix a bug that execute the subscriptions twice when the connection to server has been establised before when a new tunnel want to publish a new message. Can reproduce this bug by create a tunnel, publish or subscribe. Create another tunnel on same app domain, subscribe, then publish. The second tunnel will run the subscription again as the dedicated channel is not created.

- Change the PreFetchSize data type to uint which enventually let the app prefetch everything in the queue if the size is larger than ushort.MaxValue
